Network Performance Optimization Tool

##Overview

The Network Performance Optimization Tool is a simple C++ application designed to analyze network traffic data and provide basic optimization suggestions. The tool reads network traffic data from a file, processes it to aggregate information per IP address, and then analyzes the data to identify potential performance issues such as high latency.

## Features

- Reads network traffic data from a specified file
- Aggregates data by IP address
- Calculates average latency for each IP address
- Provides optimization suggestions based on latency analysis

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- C++11 or higher

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/sha-shankk/Network-performance-optimization-tool.git
   cd network-optimizer

#database

    Create a network data file named network_data.txt in the same directory as the source code. The file should contain network traffic data in the following format:

    php

<IP Address> <Packets Sent> <Packets Received> <Latency in ms>

Example:

yaml

192.168.1.1 1000 950 120.5
192.168.1.2 1500 1450 90.0
192.168.1.1 1100 1050 110.0
192.168.1.3 1300 1250 80.5
192.168.1.2 1600 1550 95.0

##Compile the program:

g++ -o network_optimizer network_optimizer.cpp

##Run the program:

 ./network_optimizer

Example Output

yaml

IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Packets Sent: 2100
Packets Received: 2000
Average Latency: 115.25 ms
Optimization Suggestion: Reduce latency by optimizing routing.

IP Address: 192.168.1.2
Packets Sent: 3100
Packets Received: 3000
Average Latency: 92.5 ms
Optimization Suggestion: No significant latency issues.

IP Address: 192.168.1.3
Packets Sent: 1300
Packets Received: 1250
Average Latency: 80.5 ms
Optimization Suggestion: No significant latency issues.
